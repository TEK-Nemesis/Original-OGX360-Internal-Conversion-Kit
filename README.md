# Original OGX360 Internal Conversion Kit

This project allows the ogx360 to be nicely installed inside an original Xbox.

Note:  The ogx360 is a small circuit board which allows you to use a range of modern USB controllers on the Original Xbox Console.  It was designed by Ryzee119 (Ryan Wendland) and without him, I could not have made this product for the community.  https://github.com/Ryzee119/ogx360

## General:
* This project is a culmination of work that will aid with the installation of the original ogx360 (37mm x 97mm / 1.44 inches x 3.82 inches) inside an original Xbox.  
* Individual components of this project are organized into their own folder.
* If you don't already own an ogx360 then it is *not* recommended to use this kit.  If you are starting fresh then the better option is to use the newer internal OGX360i as it was made specifically to be installed inside an original Xbox.  (The TEK Nemesis OGX360i is very small in comparison to the original OGX360).
