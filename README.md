## General:
* This project is a culmination of work that will aid with the installation of the original ogx360 (37mm x 97mm / 1.44 inches x 3.82 inches) inside an original Xbox.  
* Individual components of this project are organized into their own folder.
* If you don't already own an ogx360 then it is *not* recommended to use this kit.  If you are starting fresh then the better option is to use the newer internal OGX360i as it was made specifically to be installed inside an original Xbox.  (The TEK Nemesis OGX360i is very small in comparison to the original OGX360 and it is available on my GitHub).
