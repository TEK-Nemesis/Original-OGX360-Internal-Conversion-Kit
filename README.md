## General:
* This project is a culmination of work that will aid with the installation of the original ogx360 inside an original Xbox.  Please note that if you don't already own an ogx360 then it is recommended that you build or acquire a TEK Nemesis OGX360i (2-channel or 4-channel versions are available on my GitHub).

* Individual components of this project are organized into their own folder.
