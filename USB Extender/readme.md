# USB Extender

## Overview

The USB Extender simply extends the USB port on the ogx360, bringing a USB port to the front of the Xbox.  The reset button is optional but it may prove useful in its operation (perhaps when switching from wired to wireless controllers).

## Gerber files

<b>USB 2.0 Plug for ogx360.zip</b> - plugs directly into the ogx360 USB Port.  A 5-pin cable runs out to the Front USB piece.  (Optionally, single wires may be used.)

<b>OGX360 Front USB PCB_Gerber Files.zip</b> - this PCB gets mounted outside the case, centred under the power/eject buttons.  Use double-sided tape to secure it.
