# USB Breakout Boards

## Overview

* USB Breakout boards split USB functionality between the Xbox motherboard and the ogx360.  (The Xbox controller ports are actually proprietary USB ports.)

* I've included a little PCB that allows you two extend the 12-pin cable coming off the controller port.  Sometimes it is useful to use one with certain Xbox Revisions that don't have long Controller Port cables (e.g. 1.6).

* RYZEE119 designed the first USB Breakout Board to accept Micro USB to Micro USB Cables and 12-pin JST cables 2.00mm pitch.  The PCB is very small, measuring around 1 sq. in. in size.

* TEK Nemesis designed the second USB Breakout Board for direct wiring a Micro USB cable to the PCB (and the same 12-pin JST cables 2.00mm pitch).
