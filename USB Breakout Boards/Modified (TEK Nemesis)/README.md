# USB Breakout Board (by TEK Nemesis)

## Overview

* This PCB was designed by TEK Nemesis. It uses Micro USB cables (cut open at one end) and 12-pin JST cables.
* The Micro USB cable is soldered to the PCB like this:
- red wire to VBUS
- black wire to GND
- green wire to D-
- white wire to D+
* Note that there are markings on the PCB to indicate the Controller Port:  P1/P3, P2/P4.  Plug the Micro USB cable into the appropriate Micro USB port on the ogx360.
* An STL will be made at a later date (to serve as a case for this PCB).
